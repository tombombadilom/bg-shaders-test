# Background Shaders Test

These are just some test I've made with the new lib [@funtech-inc/use-shader-fx](https://github.com/FunTechInc/use-shader-fx). demo is [here](https://use-shader-fx.vercel.app/)

Just to see how can be recuperated the css variables from a theme and therefore inversed when mode switch from light to dark 

## todo's 
- adapt to client side GPU speed
- scaling performance ...
